9/14/2025 23:25:19,l.venuti@unsw.edu.au,Colours of accretion in young stellar objects as tracers of protoplanetary disks’ inner structure,"Disk accretion governs the first few million years of a star's life, with a long-lasting impact on the fundamental properties of the star and any associated planets. As a result of star-disk interaction, the inner disk is truncated at a characteristic radial distance from the star, causing a density gradient that can act as an effective trap for the innermost planets. The inner disk truncation radius is a key parameter to predict the evolution of star-planet-disk systems; however, its location is hard to constrain observationally, and direct measurements are currently scarce and inhomogeneous. In this talk, I will discuss a new photometric technique to infer the inner disk structure around individual young stars that combines time domain measurements of stellar luminosities at optical and near-ultraviolet wavelengths with state-of-the-art simulations of disk accretion. Application of this technique to data from existing and upcoming survey missions has the potential to enable the first large-scale survey of inner protoplanetary disk sizes, shedding new light on in-situ formation vs. migration scenarios for planets on short-period orbits.",Laura Venuti,SETI Institute / UNSW Sydney,Planets,scheduled ,disks,Mv to plandts,,,,5,5.00

In this work, we explore an alternative detection method by leveraging apsidal precession as a dynamical signature of planetary companions. We analyze a large sample of eclipsing binaries from the Gaia catalog (~2 million systems), supplemented with photometry from TESS and ground-based surveys, to identify systems exhibiting measurable precession. Considering this set of precessing systems, we target these candidates for follow-up spectroscopy to constrain the mass and orbital properties of potential third bodies. We present a new set of CBP candidates identified through this precession-based method, offering an avenue for probing planet formation and dynamical evolution in non-coplanar, multi-body stellar environments.",Margo Thornton,UNSW Sydney,Planets,scheduled,dynamics/binaries,,,,,,

Among these worlds, the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b stands out as one of the most strongly irradiated planets known. Orbiting an A-type star at blistering proximity, its atmosphere is actively evaporating into space. Using high-resolution optical transit observations, we detect—for the first time—metals such as sodium and iron escaping into a comet-like tail behind the planet. This observation reveals that intense stellar radiation can drive not only hydrogen but also heavier, refractory elements out of planetary atmospheres. By modelling the escaping material, we directly constrain outflow speeds and mass-loss rates, offering a detailed picture of the tail’s kinematics. These results underscore the role of stellar irradiation in shaping both the structure and composition of close-in giant planets. KELT-9b thus serves as a natural laboratory for probing atmospheric escape, star–planet interactions, and the long-term evolution of planetary systems under extreme conditions.",Nicholas Borsato,Macquaire University & Lund University,Planets,,atmosphere,,,,,,

The extreme temperatures in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters are expected to drive molecular dissociation, producing neutral atoms within their inflated upper layers. Ground-based high resolution transmission spectroscopy in the optical regime is a powerful method for detecting atomic species and probing the atmospheric structure of these exoplanets.

Cross-correlation also reveals a significant net blue-shift in the planetary Fe absorption feature of KELT-25b, which cannot be reasonably explained by a day to night side wind. We attribute this to an orbital eccentricity (e ∼ 0.15). This is the first reported use of high resolution transmission spectroscopy to derive the eccentricity of an exoplanet.",Owen Downes,University of Southern Queensland,Planets,scheduled,hi res spec,,,,,,
9/2/2025 16:40:27,alpourmand@gmail.com,Investigating Second-Generation Planet Formation,"Disks around evolved binaries, such as post-AGB systems, share many similarities with protoplanetary disks (PPDs) around young stars, raising the possibility that planet formation may also occur in these environments. This is supported by multiple observations that point to ongoing planet formation in these disks. Having excluded that planets in post-AGB disks form by gravitational instability, in this work, we examine the feasibility of planet formation via core accretion in post-AGB disks by estimating the timescales for the key growth stages: dust coagulation, streaming instability, pebble accretion, and gas accretion. We speculate whether streaming instability can operate in these disks and estimate the typical masses of the resulting planetesimals. Our results suggest that in sufficiently massive post-AGB disks with locally enhanced solid-to-gas ratios, streaming instability can produce planetesimals large enough to enter the rapid Hill regime of pebble accretion, enabling growth to planetary masses in times as short as <10,000 years. We conclude by discussing that the large aspect ratios of post-AGB disks significantly increase the pebble isolation mass, opening the possibility of forming “rocky Jupiters”: terrestrial planets that are far more massive than previously anticipated.",Ali Pourmand,Macquarie University,Planets,scheduled,disks,,,,,,

Here, we present the first atmospheric detection of an exoplanet made with Veloce, the Australian-built high-resolution spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, using a fully domestic reduction pipeline produced by the University of Southern Queensland. We observed a single transit of WASP-189b, a highly irradiated ultra-hot Jupiter orbiting a bright A-type star. Using the cross-correlation technique, we detected strong absorption from ionised calcium (Ca II), with tentative signals from additional atomic and ionic species including H, Na, Mg, Fe, Ti, and Sr. The Ca II triplet is clearly resolved in the red arm of Veloce, demonstrating both the instrument’s sensitivity and the robustness of the new pipeline. This detection serves as a proof of concept that the AAT and Veloce can deliver science-grade atmospheric spectra using established high-resolution techniques. With Ca II strongly detected, the path is now open for more detailed investigations—such as resolving individual absorption lines to probe different layers of a planet’s atmosphere or assessing temporal variability across multiple transits with a consistent observing setup. These capabilities create opportunities not just for follow-up of ultra-hot Jupiter’s, but for developing Australia’s presence in high-resolution exoplanet spectroscopy. With near-exclusive access to Veloce, the Australian community is now equipped to pursue this frontier and build the expertise needed to contribute to a globally expanding field.",Nicholas Borsato,Macquarie University & Lund University,Planets,scheduled,veloce/hi res spec,,,,,,
9/6/2025 13:19:11,j.bailey@unsw.edu.au,Absorption and Scattering in the Atmospheres of Stars and Planets,"When light interacts with the material in the atmosphere of a star or planet it can do so through absorption (photons disappear and their energy goes into heating the gas), or scattering (photons change direction and polarization). However in stellar astrophysics these two processes are confusingly combined together and referred to as 'opacity'. Absorption and scattering are quite different processes and must be treated as such for accurate modelling. I will describe techniques for correctly handling the modelling of scattering and the resulting polarization in the atmospheres of stars and planets.  The interplay between scattering and absorption is important for understanding diverse phenomena such as how we can see through the clouds of Venus, how stars reflect light, and how the poolarization of stars varies across the HR diagram.",Jeremy Bailey,UNSW,Planets,scheduled,polarimetry,,,,,,

In this talk, we will showcase the complete 0.8-5 micron transmission spectra of a ~800K Neptune. In combination, these observations allow us to measure the chemical composition and atmospheric processes of the atmosphere in detail. From the combined spectrum we retrieve H2O, CO2, CH4 and SO2, and show that the spectra cannot be explained fully by equilibrium chemistry. When combined with constraints from optical transits from TESS and CHEOPS, we are able to derive a super-Rayleigh slope due to Haze. This is the first JWST spectrum of a Neptune that definitively migrated through disk to their current orbit location -- as inferred due to the orbital architecture of the planet system with an interior transiting Neptune and an exterior transiting gas giant.

9/9/2025 16:37:21,evgeni.grishin@monash.edu,Hot Jupiters in Old Wide-Binary systems,"Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets on short orbital periods less than $10$ days, found around $\sim 0.5$–$1\%$ of Sun-like stars. While multiple pathways have been proposed for their formation, their origins still remain debated. The high prevalence of stellar companions , the eccentricity distribution of 'cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin–orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity (high-e) migration, where planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. However, existing high-e migration models are inefficient in converting the initial cold Jupiter population to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\lesssim 30\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$–$15$ . These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $<40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a > 10^3$ au), perturbed by the Galactic tidal field, produce $1.8\pm0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$–$40\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \ge 2.5\ \rm Gyr$. Furthermore, $\sim 20\%$ of systems eject proto-HJs, generating free-floating giant planets (FFGPs) that contribute to the observed FFGP population, and reduce the cold Jupiter population and resolve the Cold/Hot ratio discrepancy, yielding a unified theoretical framework whose predictions can be directly tested by upcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys.",Evgeni Grishin,Monash University,Planets,Scheduled,dynamics/binaries,,,,,,

We also analyze ground-based follow-up photometric data from the Wendelstein Observatory (WST), Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), and Wild Boar Remote Observatory (WBR). TOI-2155\,b is a short-period brown dwarf with $P=3.7246950 ^{+0.0000029}_{-0.0000028}$~days.

The effective temperature of the subgiant host star is estimated at $T_{\rm eff} = 6085\pm 78$ K, which identifies it as an F-type star with a radius $R_{\thinstar} = 1.705^{+0.066}_{-0.064}$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$ and a mass $M_\star = 1.33 \pm 0.008$~M$_\odot$.

While optical and infrared observations reveal orbital and physical properties, only low-frequency radio wavelengths can directly probe planetary magnetic fields. Electron cyclotron maser emissions from stellar wind–magnetic field interactions, and planetary aurora, provide promising signatures of exoplanetary magnetospheres. However, such emissions are extremely weak and have only been tentatively detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity and resolution of current low-frequency interferometers. Radio Interferometers measure in Fourier space, and the complex image synthesis combined with ionospheric and instrumental effects requires precise calibration, which can introduce biases and obscure exoplanetary signals. Direct imaging of such faint emissions may therefore not be the optimal approach. This motivates the application of statistical techniques, widely used in cosmology, to identify weak signals. In 21-cm cosmology, the 2D power spectrum is a common metric: different systematics and astrophysical emissions leave distinct, recognizable imprints in this space, allowing them to be isolated and constrained. Building on this, we investigate the potential for detecting exoplanetary radio signatures using the 2D power spectrum. Firstly, we employ WODEN to simulate circularly polarized exoplanetary emissions in the 73–105 MHz range, matched to the capabilities of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The simulated data are processed with MWA-specific tools—PyFHD for calibration and εppsilon for power spectrum estimation—cross-validated with LOFAR-based tools like PSPIPE. We present our methodology and preliminary power spectra, investigating the potential of statistical techniques for exoplanetary studies , and outlining a framework for future searches with more sensitive instruments.

9/11/2025 15:02:39,p.mistry@unsw.edu.au,Characterizing CCD Gain and non-Linearity in the Veloce Spectrograph.,"Extreme-precision radial velocity requires measuring line centroids to within thousandths of a spectrograph’s resolution. At this level, multiple factors can produce small systematic changes in the line profile shape, resulting spurious radial velocities at the 1-20m/s level. A key example is CCD non-linearity—the deviation of recorded counts from the true number of photoelectrons. Though common, it is rarely quantified in detail or incorporated into RV pipelines, yet it can bias velocities when instrumental line profiles are asymmetric, affecting shallow and deep lines differently.

We applied the photon-transfer method to characterize non-linearity in Veloce’s CCDs. Traditionally used for gain calibration, this technique probes detector response using flat-field frames across a wide dynamic range. Its behaviour in saturated regions, however, raises questions about whether the inferred response there, is physically meaningful. To test this, we are developing a complementary approach that compares flat-fields with varying exposure times. By examining whether this method reproduces the same trends or highlights discrepancies, we aim to identify whether the issue lies in the photon-transfer analysis, in the saturated regions themselves, or both. This cross-check offers a more reliable route to understanding detector response and its impact on radial velocity precision.

Although motivated by Veloce, the methodology is general and can applied to other high-precision spectrographs to identify detector-induced biases and improve stellar RV precision beyond current pipelines.",Priyashkumar Mistry,"University of New South Wales, Sydney",Planets,scheduled,veloce,,,,,,

One of the ways to resolve this issue is the capture of Interstellar planetesimals by the drag force of a young protoplanetary disk. In binary systems, truncation of the protoplanetary disk and unstable orbital regions further increases the challenge of planet formation. However, approximately 11-12% of discovered planets are in binary or trinary systems, amounting to around 700 planets in binaries. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we integrate over a million N-body systems with a prescription for gas drag to determine the crucial role of the stellar companion on the capture efficiency. We vary the orbital parameters of the binary stars to determine the critical binary separation that affects the possibility of planetesimal capture within a circumstellar disk. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results on the broader topic of planet formation within binary star systems.",Alia Pollard,Monash University,Planets,scheduled,formation,,,,,,

Located nearby at a distance of 19.28 pc with a young age of 18.5 My,  β Pictoris has a favourable edge-on disc orientation that enables the detection of exocomets in its spectrum (Ferlet et al. 1987) and light curve (Zieba et al. 2019).

Our project aims to simultaneously observe β Pictoris using spectra from the University of Canterbury Mt John Observatory and light curves from the TESS space telescope to investigate the properties of exocomets detected via these separate methods. A dedicated month-long dataset of high-resolution HERCULES spectra enables the detection of evaporating, star-grazing exocomets. TESS observations from sector 87 taken at a 120s cadence are used to detect transiting exocomets.

We have created spectroscopic and photometric pipelines to automatically detect and optimize model exocomet features in TESS light curves and ground-based high-resolution spectra. Applying these pipelines to simultaneous data obtained during TESS sector 87 shows some evidence of simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic exocomet detections. We are investigating the physical and dynamical nature of both features to understand whether both features originate from the same exocomet material or are merely coincident observations of different physical origin.",Michael Elston,University of Canterbury,Planets,scheduled,formation,,,,,,

A significant unsolved problem in the field of exoplanets is the discrepancy between the observed and predicted radii of Hot Jupiters. It has been shown in previous work that planet mass and insolation flux directly impact this phenomenon. However, such relations have thus far been investigated observationally via samples with inhomogeneous host star parameters. Here we present a homogeneous analysis of stars hosting such planets. We update the established Flux-Mass-Radius (FMR) relation, and use it to re-calculate flux-corrected planet radii. In linking these radii to homogeneous stellar parameters, we find potential trends between radius inflation and stellar mass and age, the latter of which we validate with Galactic parameters. Our results support the hypothesis that stellar evolution can influence planet inflation over time, offering new insight into the evolution histories and galactic context of Hot Jupiters.

However, our analysis of these distant worlds will only be as good as our understanding of their host stars. Characterising stellar properties at these large distances is extremely challenging due to the significant amount of dust and gas along these lines of sight, which is complicated further by high spatial variability. It is therefore vital to have accurate extinction maps of fields that are more prone to obscuring effects in order to properly understand these stellar populations. Here, I present our new, comprehensive catalogue and mapping of the Roman fields using data from CFHT (ugri) and VVV (JHK), providing coverage of all stars down to J~16 mag.

Using a JAX optics stack, we map the NIRCam weak-lens observations to an axial defocus distance for a converging f/20 beam, and combine this diversity with telescope OPD maps from MAST. Phase retrieval is performed in a physically motivated basis that includes segment level FDA terms which tests known OPDs, validating both the conversion and the inference machinery. With this calibrated defocussed PSF in hand, we adopt a two-stage strategy tailored to exoplanet and binary-star applications. First, we use the FDAs obtained from the closest-in-time wavefront sensing images and fit astrophysical parameters of source positions and fluxes, in full frame NIRCam images, thereby isolating photometry from wavefront estimation and providing a clean baseline for performance assessment. Second, we extend to two-source scenes in the same full frame images and demonstrate robust joint inference of centroid/separation/contrast in the same full frame images. This work shows that a modest number of well characterised defocus diversity, coupled to a Fresnel model and OPD priors informed by MAST, is sufficient to deliver stable, interpretable PSFs for NIRCam to investigate host stars and their planetary mass companions.",Shrishmoy Ray,Macquarie University,Planets,scheduled,imaging,,,,,,

The presence and interaction of exoplanets, exocomets and stellar pulsations offers a unique glimpse into the early lives of stars and planets.

One interesting example is β Pictoris -- a bright nearby star which hosts a complex circumstellar disk and at least two super-Jupiter planets. Gravitational perturbations by its exoplanets disrupt the orbiting planetesimals, sending them on star-grazing trajectories where they evaporate as “exocomets”. β Pic shows the highest spectroscopic exocometary activity of any system known. In addition, TESS photometry of β Pic has revealed the characteristic signatures of transiting exocomets in the system.

We have compiled a target list of bright nearby young stars that host circumstellar disks and have been reported to show exocometary signatures, either spectroscopic absorption features, or possible photometric transits. Employing long-term high-resolution spectroscopy, we are characterising the host stars on this target list and are investigating gas and orbital properties of the circumstellar disk and spectroscopically-detected exocomets. Complementary (and sometimes simultaneous) high-cadence TESS photometry allows us to detect and model the dust and orbital properties of the photometrically-detected exocomets.

The answer can be difficult to discern, because observations of misaligned planets rarely reveal how they got there. Yet the consequences are profound, as far as exoplanet orbital stability and habitability are concerned. One way to answer the question is to measure the obliquity of planet-forming discs, since that would indicate whether planets are born misaligned, but one must measure the both the disc inclination and the stellar inclination to infer any misalignment, and the stellar inclinations are the problem. Enter asteroseismology. Hot stars (> ~7000 K) often pulsate as delta Scuti stars, whose mode frequencies not only contain information about the stellar rotation rate, but can also deliver asteroseismic ages to 10% precision. Coupled with a spectroscopic vsini, one can calculate the stellar inclination, and thereby measure whether the planet-forming discs are misaligned with the host stars. I will present the method and early results from a proposed survey of dozens of systems that will fill-in the under-represented parameter space of exoplanet obliquities around hot young stars and answer this pressing question.",Simon Murphy,University of Southern Queensland,Planets,scheduled,dynamics/asteroseismology,,4,4,4,4,4.00

However, its performance has limited its effectiveness for precise RV work. In 2023, the instrument was extended to cover a broader wavelength range (396–940 nm), thereby improving its applicability to alternative scientific goals. We present a custom data reduction pipeline tailored for non-RV science, enabling meaningful use of Veloce observations beyond its primary purpose.

The pipeline supports both a quick-look data quality check and a complete end-to-end reduction. It employs simplified extraction and minimal interference with the data, rather than deconvolving light from individual fibres. We discuss the trade-offs involved in this approach and provide estimates of its impact. Wavelength calibration can be performed using a static solution, a Thorium arc lamp, or a simultaneous laser frequency comb, depending on the observational setup.

We applied the pipeline to several science cases, including examining line profile variations in delta Scuti stars and constraining the inclination of a rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star. Additionally, we reduced the data for a project led by Macquarie University, where they detected signatures from the transiting exoplanet WASP-189b.

By comparison of the values of key parameters for stellar and planet hosts, condensation temperature slopes show giant stars (log g < 3.5) are depleted in abundances of volatile elements (C, O) relative to refractory elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Ni), when compared to dwarf stars. Dwarf stars (log g >= 3.5) are categorised by whether they host a small planet (M < 30 Earth masses) (Small Planet Host, SPH) or not (Large Planet Host, LPH). The chemical signatures of SPHs and LPHs are distinguished with significance (p-value <= 0.05) in abundances of O, Mg, Al, and Mn, with features consistent with the core accretion model of planet formation. Seven LPH stars are recommended for follow-up as potential SPHs.",Ethan Bull,University of Canterbury,Planets,scheduled,star-planet,MV to planets,2,3,,5,3.33

In this talk I will present an analysis of the star’s long-term magnetic variability using Zeeman Doppler Imaging combined with Principal Component Analysis. I will also present modelling of activity-induced radial velocity variations and a search for planetary companions using ~90 days of high-cadence spectra from CARMENES and HARPS.

The inner circumstellar environments of evolved stars contain crucial information on the mechanisms that drive stellar mass loss. In the case of C-rich evolved stars, the mechanisms supporting mass loss are understood: convection, pulsation and radiation pressure. However, in the case of O-rich evolved stars, these mechanisms are not sufficient to explain the high rates of mass loss observed. One solution to this problem is an additional mechanism - that of a scattering driven flow – requiring circumstellar grains to be transparent and sufficiently large (~micron).

The VAMPIRES instrument performs polarimetric interferometry on the dusty inner circumstellar environments of evolved stars – combining the observational advantages of polarimetry, which yields access to these high contrast environments, and non-redundant aperture masking, which provides a sub-diffraction characterisation of  the material.

Here we present new scientific outcomes obtained with VAMPIRES, for the O-rich RSG mu Cephei. We present analysis of a suite of modelling techniques – demonstrating that for complex targets like mu Cephei, traditional approximations are insufficient for characterisation of the circumstellar environment. Using our image reconstruction algorithm PIRATES, combined with Bayesian Optimisation of radiative transfer simulations, we present the composition of mu Cephei’s dust, and the consequences for the scattering-driven-flow theory.",Lucinda Lilley,The University of Sydney,Stars,RSG observations VAMPIRE mass loss',,5,5,,4,5,4.75

We introduce a deep learning framework that detects flare rises directly from SXR flux using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). The architecture combines parallel convolutional branches with varying kernel sizes for multi-scale features, followed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer and Transformer encoders to refine temporal dependencies. The model outputs an onset probability at each time sample of the SXR sequence, indicating whether a flare rise has begun. Training uses 7,700 manually annotated rises sampled from 145 days spanning solar minimum to maximum, and evaluation is performed on GOES/XRS data from 2018 through June 2025. The method shows high sensitivity to short and weak rises, recovering many events missed by traditional rules. The resulting catalog contains 201,463 events versus 14,612 in the GOES archive over the same period, with the largest relative increase near the C-class range. After subtracting a local background from peak intensities, the pre- versus post-event waiting-time distributions become more symmetric, consistent with reduced bias against detections during elevated background levels (i.e., the “obscuration” effect). Bayesian-block analysis of peak-to-peak intervals further indicates substantial, time-variable flare rates. We also present an approach to assigning flares to individual active regions based on Extreme Ultraviolet imaging data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Overall, the event detection methods developed here provide a more complete and less biased characterization of flare statistics, with potential applications for flare forecasting and solar-activity modeling.",Nastaran Farhang,University of Sydney,Stars,Sun,,,4,,5,5,4.67

These stars are believed to be different stages of a shared evolutionary pathway whose progenitor is a low-mass double-white-dwarf merger (CO-WD + He-WD). They are low-mass stars (~1 Msun) with atmospheres that are helium-rich (~98% by mass) and incredibly hydrogen-deficient (<1% by mass). They have historically been difficult to study not only due to their exotic atmospheres, but especially due to their rarity and—for the RCB stars in particular—regular dust obscuration events. However, due to both the launch of the TESS mission and recent advancement in data analysis techniques, there is a new opportunity to study the variability of these stars.

In this talk, I will present my ongoing work on measuring the variability of the Hydrogen-deficient giants. Firstly, I will present the first classification of TESS light curves for all known EHe stars, which shows that a significant portion of them exhibit a type of variability previously thought to be exclusive to massive stars. Secondly, I will demonstrate the power of Gaussian Process Regression in studying the pulsations of the dusty RCB variables, allowing more precise period calculations than was previously possible, as well as an accurate characterisation of the quality of these oscillations. Finally, I will show some of the first studies of the oscillations of dLHdC stars, which marks the beginning stages of bridging the gap between dLHdC stars and RCB stars. Continuing work in this area will hopefully allow us to make better inferences about the interior of these post-merger stars, as well as help to elucidate exactly how or if these stars transition between these three phases over a single lifetime.",Courtney Crawford,University of Sydney,Stars,pulsations intermediate mass stars,,5, ,,4,5,4.67

Just a few months ago, it was suggested — based on only 33 stars from the Milky Way’s last major merger — that the spatial birth memory of the now-disrupted Gaia–Enceladus galaxy is retained in the present-day orbital energies and abundances of its stars. I set out to test this idea with a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue that underwent a similar major merger. The simulation confirms that accreted stars exhibit clear correlations between orbital energy, birth location, and chemical enrichment: metal-rich, chemically enhanced stars from the dense progenitor core end up tightly bound, while more metal-poor stars from the outskirts are less bound. Importantly, the simulation extends these signatures into lower metallicity regimes and across surviving and disrupted dwarf galaxies of different masses — regions not yet well probed by spectroscopic surveys but vital for understanding nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution across diverse stellar populations.",Sven Buder,ANU,Stars,Archeology theory,,5,4,4,5,5,4.60

Among these, [C/N] and ratios between s-process and alpha-elements (e.g., [Ce/Mg], [Zr/Ti]) are particularly valuable.

In this talk, I will present a robust method for calibrating empirical relationships between stellar ages and chemical clocks, using Kepler red giant stars with high-precision abundances and asteroseismic ages as calibrators. Applying these relationships, I derive ""chemical ages"" for hundreds of thousands of stars observed in large spectroscopic surveys, revealing key trends in Galactic stellar populations. These include the age differentiation of low- and high-alpha sequences, the age-metallicity relation, evidence of disc flaring, and the presence of old, metal-rich stars.

I will also compare the [C/N] ratios in red giant stars with stellar evolutionary models, applying mixing corrections to infer initial [C/N] abundances. This approach provides crucial insights into both Galactic evolution and the theoretical understanding of stellar mixing processes.

Overall, this work highlights the powerful synergy between asteroseismology, spectroscopy, and stellar evolution models, offering new tools to unravel the Milky Way’s formation history.",Giada Casali,Australian National University,Stars,Archeology,,4,5,4,4,5,4.40

The IMF is crucial in understanding a wide variety of astronomical phenomena like the chemical enrichment of galaxies, the rate of supernovae Type Ia explosions and the formation of exotic stars. We determined the IMF of three open clusters: Alpha Persei, Pleiades and Praesepe using Gaia DR3 proper motions and parallaxes. Corrections were applied for unresolved binaries, dynamical evolution, and mass segregation using a combination of N-body simulations and machine learning in a Bayesian framework. This approach allowed us to constrain the most probable initial conditions, including stellar number, binary fraction, radius and mass function. We find that the average IMF of the three clusters is consistent with the bottom-light form observed in globular clusters, though with cluster-to-cluster variation. These results provide new constraints on the universality of the IMF and on models of early cluster evolution.",Lachlan Hobart,University of Queensland,Stars,IMF/clusters,,4,4,4,4,5,4.20

The largest such surveys target anywhere from ~10^7 to ~10^9 stars (e.g., LAMOST and Gaia XP, respectively), generally at low or moderate spectroscopic resolutions. Yet the gold standard for determining stellar parameters and elemental abundances remains high-resolution spectroscopy, and even the largest high-resolution surveys to date (e.g., GALAH and APOGEE) contain data for only ~10^6 stars. How can we bridge this gap – spanning orders of magnitude in terms of data quantity – between the traditional cottage industry of high-resolution spectroscopy and the mass-production demands of low-resolution spectra like those from Gaia?
Fortunately we have entered an industrial revolution in stellar spectroscopy, in which machine learning methods – trained on high-resolution data – can be applied to enormous datasets, with impressive results. I will give an overview of some recent examples of spectroscopic industrialisation, such as parameters and metallicities for ~200M stars with Gaia XP spectra (e.g., Renae+ 2023, Zhang+ 2023, Khalatyan+ 2024), and focus on recent work using The Cannon for label transfer from GALAH to Gaia RVS spectra, revealing a wealth of elemental abundances for over 600k stars (Das+ 2025) – including work to measure neutron capture elements for a subset of over 300k giants.

About 50 systems are known, yet, their formation remains a mystery. The observed periods of the binaries, 100-2000 days, suggest these systems have undergone a binary interaction once the primary entered the RGB or AGB phase - sufficiently strong so as to strip and eject enough of the giant star’s envelope to create the CBD, whilst also being weak enough to preserve the intermediary period and high observed orbital eccentricities. We have conducted SPH simulations, with varying mass ratios, two equations of state, and of both RGB and AGB common envelopes (CE), as well as simulations of a number of CBD configurations to glean insight into this elusive ‘goldilocks’ interaction. We find mass ratios towards unity and beyond stabilise mass transfer such that the CE can be weakened, thus helping to preserve the orbital period, resulting in post-interaction binaries with periods at the low end of the observations. Additional considerations result in a preliminary conclusion that there are multiple, albeit related pathways into this class of objects. The final solution of the riddle of their existence will give great insight into mass transfer stability and orbital element evolution in binary interactions.",Jack Nibbs,Macquarie University,Stars,,,Abstain,4,4,,4,4.00
9/11/2025 16:51:02,kayla.martin@hdr.mq.edu.au,The Disk Strikes Back: Accretion and Depletion in Evolving Post-giant Binaries,"Post-giant binaries are unique systems that host stable circumbinary disks, formed from previously ejected stellar material, and exhibit unusual orbital characteristics resulting from complex binary interactions. Gas from the disk, which is deficient in heavy elements, is re-accreted onto the central stars, producing metal-poor surface abundances — a phenomenon known as chemical depletion. This study investigates how re-accreted gas from the circumbinary disk drives chemical depletion in a sample of six post-giant binary stars and how this process influences post-giant stellar evolution. Additionally, we assess whether re-accretion can account for the observed absence of ionised planetary nebulae (PNe) in many post-giant systems. We find that high accretion rates (> 1e-7 Msun/yr) and substantial disk masses (> 1e-2 Msun) are required to reproduce the observed chemical depletion, particularly in hotter post-giant stars (Teff > 6000 K). While such rapid accretion significantly prolongs post-giant lifetimes by factors of 3 to 10, the resulting evolutionary timescales remain within the PN visibility window. This suggests that accretion alone is insufficient to explain the lack of ionised PNe in post-giant systems. Our results constrain accretion-flow parameters and offer valuable insights into disk-mediated binary evolution during the post-giant phase.",Kayla Martin,Macquarie University,Stars,,,Abstrain,4,4,,4,4.00

Here we present more than 1500 high-precision polarization observations of 29 bright supergiants of spectral types O4 to A7. The observations show that stochastic polarization variability is seen in most objects and has timescales and amplitudes that correlate with the photometric variability seen by TESS.

We used the MESA code to synthesise the Galactic population of post-red giant interaction binaries. We found that the fairly diverse resulting population agrees well with two different observed counterparts. Nearly complete envelope stripping through stable mass transfer, followed by core helium ignition, produces blue/UV-bright hot composite subdwarf binaries. Our predicted rates, periods, mass ratios, and metallicities match those of the observed systems. Furthermore, partial stripping experienced by most other binaries, also followed by core helium ignition, produces stripped horizontal branch stars, some of which end up in the instability strip and become metal-rich RR Lyrae. These metal-rich RR Lyrae exist in the Galactic thin disc at rates compatible with the predicted ones. Their existence has been considered a conundrum for a relatively long time, as previously most RR Lyrae had been discovered in old and low-metallicity environments, believed to form through single evolution. Therefore, we show that long-period hot subdwarfs and metal-rich RR Lyrae are stellar relatives, sharing a common formation story.

Until now, unresolved main-sequence binaries have been accessible mainly in the crowded cluster centres through Hubble Space Telescope observations, leaving their large-scale distribution unexplored.

Using imaging from the Rubin Observatory’s Data Preview 1, we have measured unresolved main-sequence binaries across the outer regions of 47 Tucanae, nearly out to the tidal radius. We find that the binary fraction in the outskirts is about three times higher than in the core — an unexpected rise that provides strong constraints on the cluster’s initial binary population and the dynamical processes that redistribute binary systems over time.

These results underscore the importance of mapping binary stars across the full spatial extent of globular clusters, offering new insights into their primordial conditions and long-term evolution. While Rubin DP1 enabled this first demonstration, the broader implications reach well beyond a single dataset, pointing to a new way of understanding the origin and dynamical history of binary stars in dense stellar systems.",Giacomo Cordoni,Australian National University,Stars,Binary pop in GCs,,2,5,5,,4,4.00

However, validating the emerging picture of neutrino-driven explosions is challenging. Gravitational waves and neutrinos as signatures from the supernova core offer tremendous prospects in the event of a Galactic supernova, which happens only every few decades. Recently, our group has begun to investigate photospheric spectra and light curves as probes of the explosion dynamics and morphology. This talk will present results on light curves and spectra obtained for a stripped-envelope supernova model using 3D Monte Carlo radiation transport. Asymmetries in the ejecta distribution lead to a considerable viewing-angle dependence that needs to be taken into account when interpreting the light curves of individual transients. The viewing-angle dependence would also imprint patterns in the distribution of brightness and light curve width in the stripped-envelope supernova population, which may be used to observationally constrain explosion asymmetries in future.

With drastically fluctuating characteristics, it is the primary driver of space weather and, therefore, maintains the Sun-Earth connection. Space-based observations show that there exist two different categories of solar wind, distinguished by their outflow speed, dynamic nature, and composition. The properties of the fast solar wind are well explained by established theory, but by contrast, the Slow Solar Wind (SSW) and its origin, composition, and high degree of variability remain a mystery. The Earth and other solar system planets are embedded in the highly fluctuating SSW for almost half of the 11-year solar cycle period. Hence, deciphering the origin of the slow solar wind is extremely crucial for understanding and predicting space weather near the Earth.

The aim of this scientific exploration is to test the leading hypothesis, the role of the Interchange Magnetic reconnection (IMR) process in the formation of SSW. Here, we present a state-of-the-art computational modelling using the MPI-AMRVAC code that includes several layers of the solar atmosphere, starting from the cool chromosphere to the million Kelvin hot solar corona extending to 30 solar radius and a realistic coronal field topology inspired by the observed coronal magnetic field. First, we set up our model based on a Helmet streamer and Pseudostreamer magnetic configuration and then systematically increase the complexity by incorporating several critical physical processes, e.g., anisotropic heat conduction, optically thin radiative cooling, and volumetric coronal heating. In the next step, we relax the model to reach a quasi-equilibrium state and then introduce bottom boundary driving, mimicking the supergranulation motion.

By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the
observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope.

This typically takes place when one of the two stars expands on its journey to becoming a giant. Typically, the more compact of the two stars experiences a (gravitational) drag force at the hand of the envelope of the larger star, which leads to either the complete ejection of the common envelope, or to the companion merging with the primary's core. CEs are thought to be the main mechanism to form compact evolved binaries such as the neutron star binaries, NS-black-hole or binary black holes that can merge and generate observable gravitational waves. It is entirely plausible that the transients named luminous red novae are common envelope interactions caught in the act. 3D simulations are required to quantify the CE physical mechanism, due to the complex asymmetric nature of CE evolution. To constrain the simulations and make them effective tools to explain observations, we need to predict light curves.

Yet, this interaction is one of the most poorly understood phases of binary evolution. Current models rely heavily on the traditional energy balance (α) formalism, which has consistently failed to reproduce observed post-common envelope populations with its simple physical assumptions.

The two-stage formalism introduced by Hirai & Mandel (2022) offers a more physically motivated approach by separately modelling the inspiral and envelope ejection. However, this framework has only been studied for high-mass stars (>12 M☉). Intermediate-mass stars (2–8 M☉) share a similar structure on the red giant branch to their high-mass counterparts, suggesting the formalism is also relevant. These stars produce the massive white dwarfs that serve as the progenitors for Type Ia supernovae and accretors in novae systems.

Here, I present the first systematic application of the two-stage formalism to intermediate-mass stars with binary population synthesis.

These stacked spectra are created in fine bins of Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], using a weighted median approach. This differential approach with EPIC significantly improves the internal precision of stellar parameter estimates while minimizing systematic errors. With precise metallicities and bolometric luminosities derived from Gaia DR3 parallaxes, we then fit GARSTEC stellar evolution models across a grid of helium and metal abundances to infer individual helium mass fractions (Y) for K-dwarfs. This allows us to estimate the ΔY/ΔZ ratio and extrapolate to Z = 0 to determine the primordial helium abundance (Yₚ). Our results will provide new observational constraints on both stellar evolution theory and cosmological predictions of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.",Ankita Mondal,Swinburne University of Technology,Stars,archeology,,2,4,4,3,5,3.60

While much progress has been made for solar-like oscillators and red giants, long-period variable (LPV) stars remain less well understood. These luminous, evolved stars exhibit complex oscillation patterns dominated by long-period modes, offering a unique but challenging window into late stellar evolution.
I have developed methods tailored to LPVs using TESS observations. I have constructed simulated LPV-like spectra that include realistic noise sources and applied cross-correlation techniques to compare them with theoretical model spectra. Unlike earlier studies that relied on a single/solar-mass model grids, I use an extended grid spanning a range of stellar masses. This framework is being used to test whether global seismic parameters such as νmax and Δν can be extracted from TESS data, and whether these in turn can be used to estimate stellar properties such as radius and mass.
This is a new approach to studying luminous red giants to help better understand these challenging stars and improve our understanding of their late evolutionary phases.

As the oscillations travel deep into the star their properties are influenced by the interior structure and the physical processes, such as chemical element and angular momentum transport, that largely impact the stellar evolution. Thus, by comparing observed stellar oscillations with theoretical ones derived from the stellar models through a process referred to as asteroseismic modelling, we can calibrate both the models and the stellar structure and evolution codes used to calculate them.

In order to perform asteroseismic modelling, a crucial first step is being able to properly identify the oscillations that are observed, which is particularly challenging to do for intermediate- and high-mass stars.  As a minimum, the degree l (ell) which represents the total number of surface nodes associated with the oscillation has to be known. One way of determining the l value is through multicolour photometry. As a star pulsates, the pulsations result in changes to its temperature and geometric cross-section, which in turn results in variations to the surface brightness of the star. The geometry of the temperature variations caused by different spherical degrees results in the light variations to be wavelength dependent. Therefore, multicolour photometry provides a unique way of obtaining the mode identification of observed stellar oscillations. With this talk I will present a preliminary study which investigates the prospects of combining data from current and future space telescopes (TESS, Gaia, PLATO, Roman, and JWST) to derive the spherical degrees of stellar oscillations from multicolour photometry of B-type stars.

First, we establish an age limit beyond which regular pulsation patterns cease to occur in evolved delta Scuti stars. This limit occurs when the l=1 mixed n=2 mode undergoes an avoided crossing with the n=3 p-mode, disrupting the regular frequency spacing. We parameterize this maximum age using the timing of the l=1, n=2 crossing and demonstrate its systematic dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, and rotation.

Second, we demonstrate that low-order g-modes and surface-trapped f-modes naturally align with prominent observed peaks near the fundamental radial frequency, without requiring explicit fitting.  Moreover, we show examples where identification of g-mode splittings allows us to provide independent constraints on stellar rotation, inclination, and internal structure beyond traditional inference method based on p-mode frequency splittings.

In recent years, eMSTOs have been interpreted as signatures of fast stellar rotation, but the role of rotational mixing in shaping the colour–magnitude diagram (CMD) of these clusters remain uncertain.
I will present a comparison between observed and synthetic CMDs for two intermediate-age clusters, NGC 419 and NGC 1817. Both clusters show a clear eMSTO and eRC, with turn-off stars showing large v sin i values. We used two grids of rotating stellar models, identical in input physics except for the efficiency of rotational mixing, to build synthetic clusters.
Our results show that models with weak rotational mixing best reproduce both the eMSTO and eRC features and match the red clump luminosities and asteroseismic masses in NGC 1817. Strong mixing leads to post main-sequence CMD features that are too bright and inconsistent with observations.
Overall, our findings suggest that rotational mixing might play a role in shaping eRCs, but its influence on intermediate-mass stellar evolution is definitely weaker than current stellar models predict.",Lorenzo Martinelli,The University of Newcastle,Stars,MHD simulations - numerical techniques,,2,4,4,3,4,3.40

For more distant clusters, we find that the relative proportion of high-mass-ratio  binaries increases with the overall frequency of binary stars and decreases with cluster age.

The leading hypothesis for the SSW origin is interchange reconnection at the interface between open and closed magnetic flux in the corona. This suggests that closed flux near coronal hole boundaries influences the composition of SSW plasma released into the heliosphere along open flux. We investigate the topology of this closed flux using two coronal magnetic field models: a potential field source surface model and a time-dependent magnetofrictional model. We explore differences in the topologies predicted by the models in the polar and ecliptic planes across several phases of Solar Cycle 23, and consider how these differences relate to Ulysses spacecraft observations of solar wind speeds and compositions.

However, there are limited ways to validate the models against observational data. Here, we use Gaussian separation, recently applied to solar vector magnetogram data, to investigate the accuracy of NLFFF models constructed with two methods: optimisation and the current-field iteration (CFIT) implementation of the Grad-Rubin method. Gaussian separation partitions the photospheric vector magnetic field into three components, each associated with currents flowing below, above and passing through the photosphere, respectively. Comparing the components of the photospheric magnetic field due to coronal currents in a NLFFF model with those in the original vector magnetogram data, which is the basis for the model, provides a check on the accuracy of the coronal currents in the model. We consider NLFFF models constructed for the active region AR 11429, which produced an eruptive, X-class flare. We find that the photospheric signatures of coronal currents derived from the models are qualitatively similar, but have distinct differences, to those derived from the vector magnetogram data. These differences are due in part to the changes made to the vector magnetogram boundary data in the models when solving the NLFFF equations and the assumptions underlying the models. The photospheric signatures in the models and the vector magnetogram data indicate coronal currents flowing above and parallel to central, sheared polarity inversion lines (PILs) in AR 11429, consistent with recent studies.

This system displays a short orbital period of ~1.3 hours, determined from Doppler shifts in Balmer emission lines, and exhibits unique radio emission characteristics.

We observed periodic bursts of elliptically polarised radio emission -- displaying frequency drift and intermittency -- aligned with the orbital period. As well as coincident X-ray and UV emission, which may indicate potential accretion.

This system occupies a crucial evolutionary space, bridging cataclysmic variables and long-period transients, with an orbital period shorter than other known long-period transient associated with white dwarfs. The radio emission's high brightness temperature and elliptical polarisation necessitates a coherent mechanism. We find the observations can be explained by a relativistic electron cyclotron maser operating within the magnetic field lines connecting the white dwarf and its companion.

Our analysis allows us to probe the system's magnetic field structure and plasma transfer dynamics.

Precise formulation of the center-to-limb intensity profile is therefore critical for determinations of stellar radii and effective temperatures. An accurate description is also vital for exoplanet transit spectroscopy. Long-baseline optical interferometry, utilizing the Precision Astronomical Visible Observations (PAVO) beam combiner at Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) with baselines extending 200–300 m, enables accurate measurements of angular diameters and limb-darkening profiles for 15 giant stars. By implementing inverse Fourier transform, we recover the center-to-limb intensity profiles of the stars and find their angular diameters. By coupling interferometric angular diameters with Gaia parallaxes and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we derive robust stellar radii and temperatures. Interestingly, radii derived in this method from PAVO appear to be systematically lower by around 2% than that predicted by the 3D STAGGER atmosphere models, hinting at potential refinements needed in theoretical prescriptions. For targets exhibiting solar-like oscillations, we further employ asteroseismic analysis using light curves from observations made by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to obtain independent measurements of the fundamental parameters.

They are also the progenitors of compact remnants, such as neutron stars and black holes, and therefore play a key role in the formation of gravitational-wave-driven mergers like those detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Although massive stars have been studied extensively, many aspects of their evolution remain uncertain. This is especially true for the remnant masses and the magnitude of the initial velocity kicks these remnants receive. Constraining these properties is critical for understanding the origin of gravitational wave events and enabling more accurate predictions of binary black hole merger rates. Our project aims to shed more light on the properties of black holes by running a set of Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters. Our simulations incorporate a realistic initial mass function, stellar evolution, and varying kick distributions for the forming black holes. We then compare the results of our simulations to a number of bright, well-observed clusters to constrain their black hole populations and infer the initial properties of these black holes. We find that newly formed black holes receive significant natal kicks, with peak velocities ranging from at least 40 km/s up to magnitudes typical for neutron stars (~265 km/s). These strong kicks are essential to eject a large fraction of these black holes from their parent star cluster, allowing our simulations to match observations.

However, nearly all other stars remain unresolved, making inference of their surface features a challenging inverse problem: reconstructing spatial distributions from temporally varying, spatially-integrated observational data. Traditional photometric light curve inversion methods suffer from severe degeneracies, with maximum entropy reconstructions limited to recovering information only for low-order spherical harmonic modes due to insufficient constraining information. These degeneracies can only be partially mitigated through highly restrictive—and sometimes unphysical—prior assumptions. We demonstrate that high-precision astrometric measurements can recover more spherical harmonic modes than photometric techniques, effectively breaking degeneracies inherent to traditional methods. The astrometric approach yields enhanced spatial resolution while remaining complementary to existing photometric approaches. Information-theoretic analysis using Fisher matrices confirms the superior performance of astrometric measurements and quantifies the fundamental limits of each observational modality.

We present a comparative analysis of α-element (Mg, Ca) abundances in six tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies, derived from high-resolution spectra obtained by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5), and compare them with literature data for surviving dwarf spheroidals. Our observations show that stars in stellar streams exhibit systematically higher [α/Fe] at fixed [Fe/H] than their intact counterparts, indicating more rapid early enrichment and distinct evolutionary pathways. These results pose challenges to current models of disruption and quenching timescales. We discuss potential formation and environmental mechanisms that could account for the observed chemical differences.",Aldo Mura Guzmán,Macquarie University,Stars,archeology,,Abstain,3,3,,2,2.67

LVM is uniquely positioned to map how stars inject energy and momentum into their surroundings, shaping chemical abundances and the thermal structure of the interstellar medium, down to 0.05 parsecs. Weak auroral and metal recombination lines are essential for robust measurements and for addressing the longstanding abundance discrepancy problem (ADP): a 50+ year systematic disagreement between abundance determination methods. Yet their very low signal-to-noise, even with LVM’s depth, remains a significant challenge for existing methods. We developed a spatially coherent model that infers emission line properties continuously across the sky, fitting tens of thousands of spectra at once. By exploiting the similarity of nearby spectra, it is especially effective at recovering weak emission lines. We demonstrate the power of this approach through its first application to the LVM Rosette Nebula dataset, recovering spatially resolved maps of faint auroral and metal recombination lines. These maps are among the first of their kind, and they provide a clear path to resolving the ADP.",Thomas Hilder,Monash University,Stars,Galaxies?,,1,2,4,3,3,2.60

Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the β ≪ 1 or β ≫ 1 regimes. In this talk, I willl introduce the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (or EEDM) and derive exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components—called eigenenergies—of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the inhomogeneous ideal MHD equations. I will also provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear partial differential equations that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, it is shown that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulation and a discussion on possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise owing to discretization will be provided.",Axel Raboonik,University of Newcastle,Stars,,,,1,3,3,3,2.50

Characterising its members deepens our understanding of stellar formation and evolution. NGC1901 is an 891-Myr-old open cluster confirmed using Gaia data and located in the TESS southern continuous viewing zone (CVZ). It is the third cluster discovered within this region, enabling a thorough investigation due to extensive available data. Our main goal is to measure the most precise age estimate of this cluster to date, using gyrochronology. Age-dating an open cluster is challenging, as different methods often yield different values. Similar analysis of UBC-1, another CVZ cluster, by Fritzewski et al. (2024), suggests how promising the approach is, when addressing targets within the CVZ. Long-duration TESS observations allow accurate measurements of rotation periods, and this is the first time NGC1901 is comprehensively characterised. As a preliminary task, we refine the NGC1901 membership list using spatial and kinematic filtering of Gaia DR3 data, and compare it to that from Hunt & Reffert (2023). We explore stellar lightcurves from TESS cycles 1, 3 and 5 to search for brightness variability indicative of rotation. The next step involves deriving the cluster's age through gyrochronology, a technique based on how rotation periods evolve with time. G, K and M-type dwarfs experience strong magnetic braking, and therefore spin down as they age. When plotted as function of colour, rotation periods highlight age-dependent sequences. In this context, we compare NGC1901's distribution to those of NGC6811 and Praesepe, which are 1 Gyr (Curtis et al. 2019) and 670 Myr old (Rampalli et al. 2021), respectively. Future work will combine gyrochronology with an independent age estimate from the asteroseismology of pulsating stars to enhance the precision of NGC 1901's age.",Mara Bernizzoni,The University of Sydney,Stars,clusters,,2,,,2,3,2.33
9/12/2025 5:43:39,muhammad.fajrin@pg.canterbury.ac.nz, Constraining the Properties of the Young A0 Star HD 110058 with Asteroseismology,"We studied a young A0 star HD 110058 known to host a circumstellar disk similar to that of β Pictoris located in the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the Sco-Cen OB association. Using photometry from TESS Sectors 10 and 11, we identified multiple frequency spectra consistent with δ Scuti-type pulsations. We found a large frequency separation of Δν = 7.34 c/d confirmed through multiple diagnostics, including Fourier transforms, autocorrelation, frequency-difference histograms, and an échelle diagram, enabling the identification of radial and dipole modes. We then explored a grid of rotating stellar models computed with MESA and GYRE to constrain the stellar properties. Our preliminary result suggests a mass of 1.53 ± 0.02 M☉ and an age of 8.60 ± 0.33 Myr. This age is consistent with the estimates for the Sco-Cen subgroup and could provide an additional benchmark for the age of the association.",Muhammad Fajrin,University of Canterbury,Stars,Stellar parameters through pulsations,,2,1,2,2,2,1.80
