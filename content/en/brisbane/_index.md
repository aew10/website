## Venue

Both workshops will be held in the [D-block Auditoirum (D100 & D101)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xRS2H8CpT4KbEAC47) at the University of Southern Queensland campus in Springfield, in suburban Brisbane. Registration will be open Monday and Wednesday mornings from 9am, and morning & afternoon tea held in the auditorium foyer. 

## Workshop Slack

We encourage you to join the [Slack workspace]( https://join.slack.com/t/sib-aew10/shared_invite/zt-2sakfxp93-2NEQLX5_iZKFazcyEt1_6w) used for both workshops. This Slack workspace will be used for LOC and SOC announcements during the workshop, but is also a place for you to ask questions of speakers, discuss topics, etc.
 
## Parking

Free parking is available on campus in either of the two USQ parking areas with a "General Parking Permit" sign. No permit is required in this area for workshop participants for the week of the workshop. Please see map attached for parking location details.

## Public Transport

The nearest train station to campus is Springfield Central Station (NOT Springfield Station), which is the end of the Springfield line, running from Springfield Central, through the city centre (Roma St, Central and Fortutude Valley stations) up to Caboolture. From Springfield Central station it is a ~16min walk to the workshop venue (D-Block Auditorium) via the Orion shopping centre and pedestrian+bike path through Robelle Domain (see walking map attached). Alternatively, there are busses (no. 533 or 528) from Springfield Central station to either the 'Education city' or 'Health Care Dr @ UniSQ' stops, and from there it is a 2 or 5 min walk to the auditorium.
