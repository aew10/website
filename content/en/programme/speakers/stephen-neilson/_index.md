## Common envelopes induced by giant planet engulfments.

Common envelopes are a phenomenon that is well studied in the context of two stars. However, a common envelope can also be created from the interaction between a star and an orbiting planet. This talk aims to explore what happens when a common envelope is created from a star engulfing an orbiting giant planet, in particular what happens to the star and the ejected stellar material after the interaction. In addition, the fate of the planet and details regarding the observation of such planetary engulfments will be also be discussed.
