## Supernovae in the context of binary evolution

Massive stars, which are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, are known to be primarily born in binary or higher order multiple systems. Therefore, binarity is essential for understanding supernova physics and conversely, the supernova physics are essential for understanding binary evolution. In this talk, I will briefly summarize how binary evolution can impact supernova explosions and how supernovae can influence binary companions and their orbits.
