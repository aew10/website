## A Comparison of the Rotation Periods of Single and Binary Planet-Hosting and Non-Planet Hosting Stars

We present an analysis of the rotation periods of stars in four categories: single stars with and without giant planets and binary stars with and without giant planets. This work seeks to assess the evolutionary influence on the presence of stellar companions and planetary companions on the formation evolution of planetary systems. Built on a sample of nearly 300 FGK stars that were systematically surveyed for both stellar companions and giant planets, our work uses TESS light curves to determine the rotation periods of stars in an effort to address how the presence of stellar and/or planetary companions can affect the angular momentum distribution within the systems. The comparison will be used to search for and characterise similarities and differences that may provide clues to the understanding of planetary formation and evolution in single and multiple star systems. We will focus on comparing the rotation periods of single stars known to host planets and not known to host planets to those of multiple stars known to host planets and not known to host planets. In particular, the angular momentum distribution of stellar systems (as measured by rotation periods of stars and orbital motion of the planets, if present) may be substantially different in planet-hosting stars as compared to non-planet hosting stars â€“ or in comparison to multiple stars with or without planets.
