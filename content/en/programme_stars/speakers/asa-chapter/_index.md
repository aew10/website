## An Exoplanets Chapter for the ASA

We would like to discuss forming an ASA Exoplanets chapter. This would require writing a charter along [the ANITA model](https://anita.edu.au/charter.html).

This will be drafted prior to the meeting and discussed. There is a question about scope (exoplanets? stars and planets? including planetary science?) but if we got organised and run it by the ASA first we might even be able to hold an inaugural meeting, appoint a chair and steering committee, etc. The main item of business would then be “who’s running the workshop next year”.
