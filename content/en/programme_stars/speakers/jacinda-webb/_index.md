## Hierarchical Star Formation in Messier 17

We investigate the hierarchical architecture of star formation across Messier 17, the Omega Nebula, using Gaussian kernels and two-dimensional binning statistics. We explore the clustering properties and stellar luminosity functions of the young, main-sequence stellar populations. Our analysis allows us to conclude that the observed hierarchy is driven by supersonic turbulence, as evidenced by the fitted fractal dimensions via $\chi^2$ optimisation of the clustering size distributions. With respect to previous studies, we identify a smaller extent of star-forming hierarchy in Messier 17, distinguishing it from older, more developed regions like the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds on galaxy-wide scales.
