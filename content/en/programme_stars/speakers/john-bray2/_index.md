## The European Space Agency (ESA) PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission: Potential false positive detections from eclipsing binary systems

For the upcoming ESA PLATO satellite mission, a large number of target stars are required to yield a statistically significant number of planet transits. Locating the long-duration observational phase (LOP) fields closer to the Galactic plane will increase the target star numbers but also the astrophysical false positives (FPs) from blended eclipsing binary systems. Here I present the results of the analysis of a synthetic rendering of the long-duration observational phase South (LOPS) field carried out as Post-Doc project for the ESA mission consortium.
