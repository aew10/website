## Astronomy in Space @ UniSQ

I will give an overview about the various current and future space astronomy programs at UniSQ. This includes our current contribution to the study of exoplanet demographics with the TESS Mission, and ongoing HST and JWST programs. UniSQ is also a partner of several space missions aiming to launch in the next 5 years, including Twinkle/Mauve with Blue Skies Space, NASA JPL/EVE and CAS/Earth 2.0. I will give a status update of Earth 2.0, and present science questions UniSQ astronomy group plans to answer with these future missions.
