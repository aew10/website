## Using population synthesis to resolve the origins of lithium-rich giant stars

This project will combine GALAH data with other sources, primarily LAMOST, to create the most comprehensive catalogue of lithium-rich giant stars. I will use my previous experience with machine learning and spectra to identify previously unknown lithium-rich giants. I will develop a comprehensive population synthesis model for RGB and red clump stars that will make it possible to test whether the various mechanisms proposed in the literature are actually responsible for the high lithium abundances in these stars.
