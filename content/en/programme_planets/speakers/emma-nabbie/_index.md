## Transit Timing Variations of TESS Multi-Planet Systems: A Catalog From the First Five Years

Transit Timing variations (TTVs) are a robust tool in measuring masses of otherwise-inaccessible planets to comprehensively probe a system’s architecture. TTVs directly constrain a multi-planet system’s dynamical history, as disk migration can produce planets in resonant orbits. We present the first results from our analysis of TTVs across 180 TESS multi-planet systems, with a focus on systems with at least one giant planet or with hosts brighter than Tmag = 12. Of the 22 systems hosting at least one giant planet, we report candidate TTV signals in 9 of them. The first of its kind, this catalog will improve upon the work of Kepler TTV catalogs, as TESS host stars are generally brighter than Kepler hosts. This increases the follow-up potential of these systems with other observation methods and enables confirmation of more tentative signals with ground-based observatories. Our catalog will facilitate future follow-up analyses of high-impact targets, such as the upcoming JWST target system TOI-1130, to connect their dynamical histories with current theories of planet formation.
