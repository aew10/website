{{% blocks/mycover title="Code of Conduct" image_anchor="top" height="full" %}}

It is the policy of these conferences that all participants are able to enjoy an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment. We are therefore committed to making its meetings and events productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality or religion. We will not tolerate harassment in any form during conference activities. This code of conduct applies to all participants of the Stars in Brisbane and Australian Exoplanet Workshop meetings. 

We ask that you follow these guidelines:
- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments related to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size or religion.
- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate. 
- Be considerate and respectful to others. 
- Do not insult or put down other attendees. 
- Critique ideas
rather than individuals.

Individuals engaging in behavior prohibited by this policy as well as those making allegations of harassment in bad faith will be subject to disciplinary action. Such actions range from a verbal warning, to ejection from the meeting or activity in question, without refund of registration fees and the reporting of their behavior to their employer and/or the ASA. Repeat offenders may be subject to further disciplinary action, such as being banned from participating in future "Stars in ..." or "Australian Exoplanet Workshop" meetings or associated activities.  Anyone who wishes to report a violation of this policy is asked to speak confidentially to any of the SOC or LOC members.

This policy is adapted from the [common policy of ASA meetings](https://asa.astronomy.org.au/membership/conduct-and-ethics/).
