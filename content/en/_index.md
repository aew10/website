The Stars in Newcastle workshop will be held in Newcastle from 17–19 November 2025, back to back with the 11th Australian Exoplanet Workshop from 19–21 November at the historic <a href="https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Rmd_CNLJxki0oGBrvcmfPcyDnk6?domain=fortscratchley.org.au/">Fort Scratchley</a>, right by the ocean.

Following the success of the combined meetings in Brisbane last year, the two conferences will again overlap: Wednesday the 19th will feature a shared program focused on star–planet interactions and crossover science, followed by a joint conference dinner (venue to be confirmed).

Stars in Newcastle is the fifth workshop in the “Stars in …” series, following Stars in Brisbane. This series showcases the breadth of Australian stellar astrophysics research, including theory and observations in asteroseismology, stellar activity, stellar evolution, clusters and population studies, and the physics of evolved stars and supernovae.

The Australian Exoplanet Workshop (AEW) brings together the Australian community of researchers working on exoplanets and related topics from both observational and theoretical perspectives. The workshop will cover all areas in observational, theoretical, and experimental exoplanetary science: we welcome talks on exoplanet surveys and discovery, atmospheric observation and theory, orbital dynamics, protoplanetary discs and planet formation, planetary host stars and star-planet interactions, and solar system planetary science.

Registration is free, and you are welcome to attend one or both conferences. Participants are encouraged to give a short presentation on their recent research & research facilities. There will also be an opportunity to discuss strategies for increasing linkages and collaborations to expand this critical research area in the future and for greater connections between stars and planet research.
